[TextBlock(citations=None, text="# A Changed World\n\nAt fifty-two, Hector Dominguez stepped through the prison gates, squinting in the harsh sunlight. Twenty years had transformed the Mexican-American father of three into a stranger in his own world. His calloused fingers fumbled with the smartphone his daughter had sent—a mysterious glass rectangle nothing like the brick-sized Nokia he'd once owned. Downtown, he froze before a café where customers spoke to empty air, white earbuds nestled in their ears, while cars without drivers hummed silently past. The corner bodega where his mother had shopped was now a sleek co-working space filled with young people staring at screens. Hector clutched his release papers tighter, the weight of two decades pressing down as he realized his punishment had only just begun—learning to exist in a world that had continued without him.", type='text')]

[TextBlock(citations=None, text="# A World Transformed\n\nAfter twenty years behind bars, 42-year-old Miguel Hernandez stepped through the prison gates into a world he barely recognized. The Latino man squinted at the sea of people walking past, their faces illuminated by the glow of smartphones, devices that had been primitive novelties when he was convicted at 22. Street corners where payphones once stood were now empty, storefronts he remembered were replaced by coffee shops filled with people staring at laptops. As a sleek, silent electric car glided past, Miguel clutched his small bag of possessions tighter, wondering how he would navigate this alien landscape that had once been familiar terrain. The city's skyline had new shapes, the language had new words, and somewhere in this strange new world, he needed to find his place again.", type='text')]

[TextBlock(citations=None, text="# Freedom's Dissonance\n\nMarcus Johnson, a 58-year-old Black man, stepped through the prison gates into a world he barely recognized. The smartphones everyone clutched like lifelines, the sleek driverless cars humming past, and even the cashless coffee shop where his confusion earned sympathetic glances—all of it felt like science fiction. He stood frozen on a street corner, watching people speak commands to invisible assistants in their ears while digital advertisements shifted on buildings, personally addressing passersby. Twenty years had transformed not just technology but the rhythm of human interaction itself. As Marcus fingered the crumpled release papers in his pocket, he realized his greatest challenge wouldn't be finding work or reconnecting with family, but navigating this alien landscape that had once been home.", type='text')]

[TextBlock(citations=None, text='# Free at Last\n\nAfter twenty years behind bars, 42-year-old Miguel Hernandez stepped through the prison gates into a world he barely recognized. The Mexican-American father of two stared in bewilderment at people walking past, heads down, thumbs tapping frantically on glowing rectangles. The payphone he sought was gone, replaced by something called a "charging station." Cars moved silently through streets, summoned by apps rather than hailed with raised hands. When a teenager bumped into him while wearing strange white earbuds and apologized not to him but to someone seemingly invisible, Miguel felt a tightness in his chest. The neighborhood bodega where he\'d once bought his mother\'s favorite pan dulce now sold something called "craft coffee" for prices that made him check his meager release funds twice. Standing still amid the rushing current of this new society, Miguel wondered if freedom could feel so much like drowning.', type='text')]

[TextBlock(citations=None, text="# A Changed World\n\nMarcus Johnson, a 45-year-old Black man, stepped through the prison gates into a world he barely recognized. After two decades inside for a crime he didn't commit, he stared bewildered at people walking past with rectangular devices held to their faces, speaking to no one and everyone. Cars moved silently on the street—electric, the guard had explained. The neighborhood where he'd grown up was now filled with coffee shops and young professionals tapping on laptops. Standing on the sidewalk with his single box of possessions, Marcus felt a complex tangle of emotions: relief at his exoneration, fear of this unfamiliar landscape, and a gnawing question of how to build a life in a world that had continued its relentless evolution without him.", type='text')]

[TextBlock(citations=None, text='# A World Beyond Recognition\n\nMiguel Hernandez, a 45-year-old Mexican-American man, stepped through the prison gates after two decades behind bars, squinting at the harsh sunlight. The smartphone in his hand—a "welcome back" gift from his aging sister—felt alien, its screen flashing with notifications he didn\'t understand. Downtown, he froze before a storefront window, watching people inside waving their hands at screens, speaking to no one yet everyone at once through wireless earbuds. A driverless car hummed past. The corner bodega where his mother once bought him candy was now a sleek coffee shop where young professionals tapped frantically on laptops. Miguel ran his fingers across the unfamiliar contours of this new world, wondering if he would ever find his place in it, or if his true sentence was only beginning now—learning to exist in a society that had continued relentlessly without him.', type='text')]

[TextBlock(citations=None, text='# A World of Screens\n\nMarcus Johnson, a 48-year-old Black man, stood frozen at the bus stop outside the prison gates, staring at the teenager whose fingers danced across a glowing rectangle. Twenty years ago, cell phones had been clunky novelties, not these sleek windows to invisible worlds. As the bus approached, Marcus noticed no one reached for cash—passengers simply tapped cards or phones against a glowing pad. The city skyline looked familiar in shape but alien in substance, glass towers reflecting clouds where brick and steel once stood. He clutched his release papers and the address of a halfway house, wondering if he could navigate this bewildering landscape where information flowed invisibly through the air and people seemed more connected to distant voices than to those sitting beside them.', type='text')]

[TextBlock(citations=None, text='# A New World\n\nJose Dominguez, a 48-year-old Mexican-American man, stepped through the prison gates into blinding sunlight, squinting at a world he barely recognized. Twenty years had transformed everything: people walked with heads bowed to glowing rectangles in their hands, cars moved silently without drivers, and storefronts stood empty with signs about "ordering online." At the bus stop, he fumbled with unfamiliar plastic money while the other passengers stared impatiently. Jose\'s stomach tightened as he realized his hard-won prison typing certificate meant nothing in this touchscreen world, but when his phone—a "welcome back" gift from his sister—chimed with a message from his daughter and a photo of grandchildren he\'d never met, something warm and forgotten stirred inside him. Perhaps not everything had changed after all.', type='text')]

[TextBlock(citations=None, text="# Freedom's Dissonance\n\nAfter twenty years behind bars, Alejandro Vasquez, a 48-year-old Mexican-American man, stepped into a world that felt like science fiction. The smartphones everyone carried, kiosks replacing human workers, and cars that drove themselves left him dizzy with disorientation. Standing outside the convenience store where self-checkout machines had replaced the cashiers he remembered, Alejandro ran his weathered fingers across the touch screen, struggling to purchase a simple coffee. A teenager noticed his confusion and gently showed him how to navigate the system. In that small act of kindness, Alejandro found his first bridge between the world he had left behind and the one he now needed to learn to inhabit.", type='text')]

[TextBlock(citations=None, text='# Out of Time\n\nMarcus Johnson, a 45-year-old Black man, stepped through the prison gates into what felt like an alien world. Twenty years had transformed everything—people walked with faces buried in glowing rectangles, cars moved silently without drivers, and storefronts stood empty where bustling shops once operated. Standing at a crosswalk, he stared bewildered as pedestrians spoke commands to invisible assistants in their ears. A teenager bumped into him, not looking up from her device, and Marcus instinctively stepped back—the old defensive posture returning. He pulled the faded address of his sister from his pocket, his one remaining connection to a world that had sprinted forward while he remained frozen in 2003.', type='text')]

[TextBlock(citations=None, text="# A CHANGED WORLD\n\nMiguel Hernandez, a 45-year-old Mexican-American man, stepped through the prison gates into a world he barely recognized. After serving twenty years for a robbery gone wrong, the smartphones everyone carried seemed like magic, the sleek self-driving cars gliding silently past made him dizzy, and the towering glass buildings reflected a sky he'd forgotten could be so vast. Standing at the bus stop, Miguel's weathered fingers struggled with the touchscreen ticket machine as teenagers effortlessly swiped and tapped around him. He thought of his mother, who had promised to wait for him but had passed five years ago, her voice now just a memory in a world that had moved forward without him.", type='text')]
