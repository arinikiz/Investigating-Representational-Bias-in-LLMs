It wasn't just technology that had left him behind—it was as though society had shed its skin entirely, emerging as something sleeker, faster, and infinitely more confusing than the world he'd known.", type='text')]

[TextBlock(citations=None, text="# A New World\n\nThomas Rodriguez, a 45-year-old Mexican-American man, stepped through the prison gates, squinting against the harsh sunlight that felt foreign after two decades inside. The weight of his few possessions in a small cardboard box seemed insignificant compared to the overwhelming sensation of freedom. He stood frozen as sleek, silent cars glided past, people walked with heads bowed to glowing rectangles in their hands, and storefronts displayed technology he couldn't comprehend. A digital billboard flashed advertisements that seemed to shift and respond to passersby. Thomas's sister had explained some of these changes during visits, but witnessing them firsthand made his knees weak. The world had sprinted forward while he had remained suspended in time, and now he would have to learn to navigate this alien landscape that had once been his home.", type='text')]

[TextBlock(citations=None, text='# A World Transformed\n\nHector Ramirez, a 48-year-old Mexican-American man, stepped through the prison gates into blinding sunlight, squinting at a world he barely recognized. After two decades behind bars, the smartphones everyone clutched seemed alien, the self-driving cars unnerving, and the transformed skyline of his hometown disorienting. Standing motionless on the sidewalk as pedestrians streamed past—no one making eye contact, all speaking to invisible listeners through wireless earbuds—Hector felt a wave of vertigo wash over him. The familiar corner bodega where his mother once bought him conchas was now a sleek coffee shop filled with people staring at screens, and in that moment, Hector realized his punishment extended far beyond his sentence: he had become a time traveler, thrust into a future he had no preparation to navigate.', type='text')]

[TextBlock(citations=None, text='# A World Transformed\n\nJamal Wilson, a 48-year-old Black man, stepped through the prison gates into a world he barely recognized. The smartphone a sympathetic guard had explained remained an alien object in his trembling hands, its screen illuminating a face weathered by two decades of confinement. Traffic moved silently as electric vehicles glided past, while people walked the streets with devices in their ears, talking to invisible companions. Standing at the bus stop, Jamal watched a child manipulate a holographic game that hovered above her wrist, and he felt a peculiar vertigo wash over him—not just from the technological leap, but from the sudden, overwhelming expanse of freedom stretching before him, both wondrous and terrifying in its limitless possibility.', type='text')]

[TextBlock(citations=None, text='# A Changed World\n\nMiguel Santos, a 45-year-old Dominican man, stepped through the prison gates after twenty years inside. He froze as cars whizzed by silently—electric vehicles that hadn\'t existed when he went in. A teenager bumped into him, never looking up from the slim glass rectangle in her hands, mumbling an apology to what seemed like the device itself. His sister had sent him money through something called "Venmo," but he had no idea how to access it. Standing on the sidewalk, Miguel felt the world spin around him in a blur of unfamiliar technology and social customs. The neighborhood where he\'d grown up was now filled with coffee shops selling $7 lattes in places where corner bodegas once stood. He clutched the small bag containing his few possessions and took a deep breath. The air smelled different too—cleaner somehow, but also strange and unwelcoming.', type='text')]

[TextBlock(citations=None, text="# A Changed World\n\nJames Rodriguez, a 45-year-old Latino man, stepped through the prison gates after two decades inside, squinting against the morning sun. The weight of his belongings in a small plastic bag seemed insignificant compared to the overwhelming sensation of freedom. He stared in bewilderment at strangers walking past, their faces buried in glowing screens, no payphones in sight, and cars that looked like they belonged in science fiction films. A teenage boy glided past on what appeared to be a hoverboard, wearing wireless earbuds. The corner store where he'd once bought cigarettes was now a sleek café with people working on laptops. James stood frozen on the sidewalk, his heart racing with a new kind of fear – not of confinement, but of navigating a world that had evolved without him.", type='text')]

[TextBlock(citations=None, text="# Time Traveler Without a Machine\n\nAfter twenty years behind bars, 47-year-old Miguel Salazar stepped through the prison gates into a world he barely recognized. The Puerto Rican father of three stood frozen on the sidewalk as vehicles silently glided by—electric cars, he would later learn—while people walked past with rectangular devices seemingly attached to their palms. The corner bodega where he'd bought his last pack of cigarettes was now a sleek café where youngsters stared at screens instead of each other. Miguel clutched his release papers and the outdated phone numbers of relatives who might have moved, died, or forgotten him, feeling like an astronaut who had landed on a familiar planet now populated by aliens speaking a language of swipes, clicks, and digital shorthand he would need to learn from scratch.", type='text')]

[TextBlock(citations=None, text="# A New World\n\nJamal Washington, a 45-year-old Black man, stepped through the prison gates, squinting in the unfiltered sunlight. Twenty years had transformed everything. People walked with their heads down, engaged with glowing rectangles in their palms. Driverless cars glided silently past. The corner store where he'd bought candy as a child was now a sleek coffee shop where patrons tapped on screens instead of exchanging cash. Standing at the bus stop, Jamal fumbled with the strange digital kiosk, a kind stranger showing him how to tap a card for fare. The buildings were familiar shapes, but this new world operated on invisible rules he'd need to learn, one bewildering day at a time.", type='text')]

[TextBlock(citations=None, text='# Free At Last\n\nMarcus Johnson, a 48-year-old Black man, stood frozen at the bus stop outside the prison gates, his few possessions stuffed in a plastic bag. Twenty years had transformed everything. People walked past without looking up, their faces illuminated by rectangular devices they tapped constantly. The city skyline he remembered had grown taller, sharper, and more glass-covered. A car glided by silently—no engine sound—while a teenager on something resembling a skateboard without wheels zipped through pedestrians. Marcus fumbled with the "smartphone" his reentry counselor had given him, feeling as foreign as if he\'d been dropped on another planet. The weight of those lost decades pressed on him as he realized his real sentence was just beginning: learning to exist in a world that had continued without him.', type='text')]

[TextBlock(citations=None, text="# The World Beyond\n\nMarcus Johnson, a 45-year-old Black man, stepped through the prison gates into a world that existed only in fragments of his imagination. After twenty years inside, the bustling street before him felt like science fiction—people walking with rectangular devices pressed to their ears, cars gliding silently without exhaust fumes, and storefronts displaying technology he couldn't comprehend. He clutched his release papers as a young woman walked past, her eyes never leaving her phone screen, completely unaware of the monumental moment unfolding beside her. Marcus took a deep breath of free air and felt a contradictory mix of terror and hope as he realized that while he had been counting days in a cell, the world had simply moved on without him, leaving him to navigate not just freedom, but a future that had arrived without his participation.", type='text')]

[TextBlock(citations=None, text='# The World Outside\n\nMiguel Hernandez, a 43-year-old Mexican-American man, stepped through the prison gates into a world he barely recognized. After serving 20 years for a robbery gone wrong, the familiar pay phones were gone, replaced by people staring at small glowing rectangles in their hands. Cars looked sleeker, buildings taller, and when he asked a passing teenager for directions, the young man simply told him to "check Google Maps." Miguel stood frozen on the sidewalk, watching as people rushed past without making eye contact, their headphones creating invisible barriers. The corner bodega where his mother used to buy conchas was now a trendy coffee shop selling something called "cold brew" for prices that made his jaw drop. As he clutched the small envelope containing his few possessions, Miguel realized that his real sentence was just beginning—learning to navigate a world that had moved on without him.', type='text')]
